# LifeSciencesTrainingDatasets

Welcome to the LifeSciencesTrainingDataset repository, her you will find a collection of datasets and accompanying scripts for learning how to analyse data, plus the knock-on effects of improper data formatting.

GitHub is a code hosting platform that allows for version control, the recording of changes made to files and the ability to revert back to older states, and collaboration between multiple users. With a repository being the way to easily organize a single project. 

Our repository currently consists of the R package "Trainingdata", containing a series of data sets, and accompanying R scripts that are examples of basic data analysis and presentation.

R is a free programming language for statistical computing and graphics. For the purposes of this data it is recommended you use RStudio, which is an integrated development environment for R that allows for the development of statistical programs.  

1. **Installing the Package**
To first begin to use our package you must install it into RStudio. You can download a zip file containing the package by clicking the green "code" button on the repositories page. This file will be in tar.gz format, which is standard for git. You will then need to extract the contents of this file, macOS and Linux uses can simply use the terminal: "tar -xzf LifeSciencesTrainingDatasets-master". While Windows users will require additional software such as 7.zip or WinRar to extract a file in this format.
Once that's done you should then see the "Trainingdata" folder within the "LifeSciencesTrainingDatasets-master" folder. Compress this file back into tar.gz format, this can be done in macOS and Linux terminals with: "tar -czf Trainingdata" and with 7.zip or WinRar on windows. 
Then if you navigate to the packages tab of the Plots and Files window in RStudio and click Install. You can select your newly compresses "Trainingdata.tar.gz" and R will install this package for you. 

You now have access to scripts and documentation for a number of data sets.
