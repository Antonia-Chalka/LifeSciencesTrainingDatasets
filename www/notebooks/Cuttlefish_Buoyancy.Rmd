```

Data
----
```{r}

Suggested Usage
---------------
A small dataset but with many quantitative measurements and a few potential confounding factors.  Gives lots of opportunity to explore the relationships between measurements and which factors have relevant influence.



Example Usage
-------------

### Plotting multiple variables

```{r}
Cuttlefish_Buoyancy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=treatment, y=weight,colour=treatment)) +
  stat_summary(geom="errorbar", fun = mean, fun.min = mean, fun.max=mean, size=2, colour="black") +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=0.3) +
  facet_wrap(vars(color))
```
