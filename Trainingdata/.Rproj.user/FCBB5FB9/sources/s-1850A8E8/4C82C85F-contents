  }
}
\details{
Tank: (5 control); (5 high CO2)
Colour: (R, Non-fed cuttlefish with the respective cuttlebone sampled once the animal started floating); (G, Fed cuttlefish with the respective cuttlebone sampled at the same time as a cuttlefish from the previous treatment started floating); (W, Fed cuttlefish with the respective cuttlebone sampled after 25 to 30 days)
Label: Number of the cuttlefish, regarding the feeding treatment
ID:ID of the cuttlefish, regarding the tank and the feeding treatment
Treatment: (A, High CO2); (C, Control)
Hatching:(1, Hatched cuttlefish); (0, Unhatched cuttlefish)
Hatching_Date: Date of hatching
Days_Until_Hatching_trt: Exposure time of the eggs to the respective CO2 treatment until hatching
Sampling_Date: Date of the cuttlebone sampling
Floating: (1, Floater); (0, Sinker)
Feeding: (1, Fed); (0, Non-fed)
Weight: Weight of the cuttlebone in mg
Area: Area of the cuttlebone in mm2
Density: Density of the cuttlebone obtained by the equation Weight/Area, represented in mg/mm2
